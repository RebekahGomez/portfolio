But now that the bugs are worked out, I'm excited to scale this project in the future to add levels, more cards, and more fun!",

Honestly, I enjoyed that there was no styling with this project - it was just code, and it was beautiful. *Note to non-developers: make sure your browser has a 'json prettier' extension, or this will all look like nonsense.",

    "description": "This was a really fun group project! We worked as a team to come up with this meme generator using React and Django. On the surface, this app looks simple, but there were a lot of complexities that went into it, such as user authentication, the ability to post comments, and prevent users from liking a post more than once.  The challenges were exciting to overcome, and I'm proud of the outcome.",
