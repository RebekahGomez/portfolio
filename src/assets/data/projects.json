But now that the bugs are worked out, I'm excited to scale this project in the future to add levels, more cards, and more fun!",

Honestly, I enjoyed that there was no styling with this project - it was just code, and it was beautiful. *Note to non-developers: make sure your browser has a 'json prettier' extension, or this will all look like nonsense.",
